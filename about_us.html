      Hi EV3 fans,<br />
      We made this app after 4 years of FLL experience, and trouble getting the
      initial movements for <br />
      navigating around the map. This app should help you move anywhere on the
      map with simple grafical input (point&click with mouse) - check the
      <a class="text" href="index.html">HELP</a>
      section to see how it’s beeing done. Continue reading if you’re interested
      in the team, or click
      <a class="text" href="index.html">HERE</a> to start using the app now.

        <br />
        One of the most frustrating parts of FIRST LEGO League for us was
        programming the robot. It was time consuming as each turn and motion had
        to be programmed, tested, tweaked and so on. One 3Geared member made it
        his personal mission to devise a faster and simpler way to program our
        robot, and this ambition grew into FLS.

        <br /><br />

        Summer of 2019. was a fruitful one for 6 young programmers with a dream.
        They dreamed of solving a problem of painful LEGO robot programming. The
        idea was to build a web app where they can describe the movements of the
        robot faster than doing it through official LEGO software.

        <br /><br />

        Many obstacles were on their path, but these young minds already had a
        good foundation in mathematics, physics, robotics and programming -
        “obstacles will be defeated“ they all agreed.<br /><br />

        On their adventure they seeked guidance of experienced Software and
        Hardware Engineers, Josip, Fran and Vlatko. They helped the young team
        to master ancient languages of HTML, CSS, and the dreaded JavaScript.
        <br /><br />
        Testing, design tweaking and wrapping up a stable app happened after the
        summer and at the start of the new FLL season.

        <h3 class="section-link">Our solution</h3>
        <br />
        We believe that sharing new techniques and ideas is a key element of all
        competitions because it challenges us to always keep improving and
        innovating.<br /><br />

        Our mission with FLS is to make life easier for fellow EV3 enthusiast,
        and also inspire others to challenge themselves to improve upon the
        existing and create original solutions to problems.<br /><br />

        FLS is a free tool that can be used by anyone to quickly, easily and
        intuitively program complex robot movements.<br /><br />

        FLS consists of 2 parts: the EV3 MyBlock and the FLS website. The FLS
        website is where the “brains” are, it calculates the needed angles,
        distances, and speeds and outputs them to a downloadable text file.<br /><br />

        The EV3 MyBlock has only 1 input, which is the name of the text file you
        download. This file is then “read” by the EV3 MyBlock which makes the
        robot move.
        <br /><br />
        Good luck :D
